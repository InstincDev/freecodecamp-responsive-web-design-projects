        <ul>
          <li>
            Elizabeth Schuyler was born on August 9, 1757, in Albany, Province
            of New York, British America. Her father, Philip Schuyler, served as
            the Continental Army General in the ‘American Revolutionary War.’
            Her mother, Catherine Van Rensselaer Schuyler, belonged to one of
            the most politically influential and richest families in New York.
            Elizabeth had 14 siblings, but only seven survived childhood.
          </li>
          <li>
            Both her parents belonged to wealthy, powerful, and illustrious
            families. Like many other landowners of the 18th century, her father
            owned many slaves. Her family followed the ‘Reformed Dutch Church of
            Albany.’ A strong and unwavering faith, which was instilled in her
            during her childhood, would continue to play a major role for the
            rest of her life.
          </li>
          <li>
            As a young girl, Elizabeth would often accompany her father to
            important meetings. She once had the opportunity to meet Benjamin
            Franklin when he stayed with her family for a brief period.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 1780, she went to Morristown, New Jersey, to stay with her aunt
            Gertrude. During her stay in Morristown, she met her future husband,
            Alexander Hamilton, who was camping in the town along with George
            Washington and his men. Hamilton at the time was one of the
            aides-de-camp of General George Washington.

            aides-de-camp of General George Washington.

          <li>
            In January 1782, she gave birth to her first child, Philip Hamilton,
            who was named after her father. After the end of the ‘American War
            of Independence’ in 1783, Elizabeth and her husband moved to New
            York City where Alexander Hamilton started practicing law. On
            September 25, 1784, she gave birth to her second child, Angelica,
            who was named after her older sister.
          </li>
          <li>
            On May 16, 1786, she gave birth to her third child, Alexander. In
            1787, Elizabeth and her husband started raising two-year-old Frances
            Antill, the daughter of Hamilton’s friend Col. Edward Antill.
            Frances lived with the Hamilton family until the age of 12, before
            leaving the family to live with her older sister. During her stay
            with the Hamilton family, she was treated like a daughter of
            Elizabeth and Hamilton.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 1787, Elizabeth sat for a portrait executed by Ralph Earl who was
            held in debtors’ prison. Hamilton had asked Elizabeth if she would
            be interested in sitting for the painter which would allow him to
            make some money which, in turn, would help him buy his way out of
            prison. Elizabeth was more than happy to help Earl and he eventually
            bought his way out of prison. On April 14, 1788, she gave birth to
            her fourth child, James Alexander.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 1789, Alexander Hamilton was appointed as the Treasury Secretary
            of the United States by the first president, George Washington. She
            aided her husband in his political career and helped him in his most
            important writings, including the farewell address of George
            Washington. In August 1792, she gave birth to her fifth child, John
            Church Hamilton.
          </li>
          <li>
            In 1791, Alexander Hamilton had a brief affair with a young woman
            named Maria Reynolds. His affair with Reynolds was divulged in 1797
            as part of his rivals’ plan to defame him. When Hamilton admitted to
            his one-year adulterous affair, Elizabeth left New York and returned
            to her parents’ home in Albany. During her stay in Albany, she gave
            birth to her sixth child, William Stephen, on August 4, 1797. She
            returned to New York to stay with her husband in September 1797, and
            later reconciled with him.
          </li>
          <li>
            She gave birth to her seventh child, a daughter, Eliza, on November
            20, 1799. On November 24, 1801, she lost her son Philip, who died
            fighting a duel with a political opponent of his father. Her eighth
            and last child, Philip (Little Phil), was born on June 1, 1802.
          </li>
          <li>
            On July 12, 1804, her husband died as a result of gunshot injuries
            sustained during a duel with the then-sitting Vice President of the
            United States, Aaron Burr. Elizabeth and her children were present
            at his bedside at the time of his death.
