        <div>
          <p>
            Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup
            language either. <strong>CSS is a style sheet language.</strong> CSS
            is what you use to selectively style HTML elements. For example,
            this CSS selects paragraph text, setting the color to red:
          </p>

          <div class="example">
            <pre>
                <code>p { 
                    color: red;
                  }
                </code>
            </pre>
          </div>
          <p>
            Let's try it out! Using a text editor, paste the three lines of CSS
            (above) into a new file. Save the file as style.css in a directory
            named <code>styles</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            To make the code work, we still need to apply this CSS (above) to
            your HTML document. Otherwise, the styling won't change the
            appearance of the HTML. (If you haven't been following our project,
            pause here to read

              >HTML basics</a
            >.)
          </p>
        </div>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Open your <code>index.html</code> file. Paste the following line in
            the head (between the
            <a
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head"
              ><code>&lt;head></code></a
            >
            and the <code>&lt;/head></code> tags):

            <div>
              <pre>
                    <code>
                        &lt;link href="styles/style.css" rel="stylesheet">
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            Save <code>index.html</code> and load it in your browser. You should
            see something like this:
          </li>
        </ol>
        <div>
          <img
            src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics/website-screenshot-styled.png"
            alt="A mozilla logo and some paragraphs. The paragraph text has been styled red by out css."
          />
        </div>
        <p>
          If your paragraph text is red, congratulations! Your CSS is working.
        </p>
        <h3>Anatomy of a CSS ruleset</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            Let's dissect the CSS code for red paragraph text to understand how
            it works :
          </p>
          <div>
            <img
              src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics/css-declaration-small.png"
              alt="close up image of the css code used to change paragragh element text red"
            />
          </div>
          <p>
            The whole structure is called a
            <strong> ruleset</strong>. (The term <em>ruleset</em> is often
            referred to as just <em>rule</em> .) Note the names of the
            individual parts:
          </p>
          <div>
            <h4>Selector</h4>
            <p>
              This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It
              defines the element(s) to be styled (in this example,
              <code>&lt;p></code>
              elements). To style a different element, change the selector.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h4>Declaration</h4>
            <p>
              This is a single rule like <code>color: red;</code>. It specifies
              which of the element's <strong>properties</strong> you want to
              style.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h4>Properties</h4>
          <div>
            <p>
              These are ways in which you can style an HTML element. (In this
              example, <code>color</code> is a property of the
              <code>&lt;p></code> elements.) In CSS, you choose which properties
              you want to affect in the rule.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h4>Property value</h4>
            <p>
              To the right of the property—after the colon—there is the
              <strong>property value</strong> . This chooses one out of many
              possible appearances for a given property. (For example, there are
              many <code>color</code> values in addition to <code> red</code>.)
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>Note the other important parts of the syntax:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Apart from the selector, each ruleset must be wrapped in curly
              braces. <code>({})</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              Within each declaration, you must use a colon <code>(:)</code> to
              separate the property from its value or values.
            </li>
            <li>
              Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon <code>(;)</code> to
              separate each declaration from the next one.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            To modify multiple property values in one ruleset, write them
            separated by semicolons, like this:
          </p>
          <div class="example">
            <pre>
                  <code>
                      p {
                          color: red;

                          width: 500px;

                          border: 1px solid black;
                        }
                    </code>
              </pre>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Selecting multiple elements</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            You can also select multiple elements and apply a single ruleset to
            all of them. Separate multiple selectors by commas. For example:
          </p>
          <div class="example">
            <pre>
                <code>
                    p, li, h1 {
                                color: red;
                              }
                </code>
            </pre>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Different types of selectors</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            There are many different types of selectors. The examples above use
            <strong>element selectors</strong>, which select all elements of a
            given type. But we can make more specific selections as well. Here
            are some of the more common types of selectors:
          </p>
          <table class="table_example">
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Selector name</th>
                <th>What does it select</th>
                <th>Example</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>
                  Element selector (sometimes called a tag or type selector)
                </td>
                <td>All HTML elements of the specified type.</td>
                <td>
                  <pre>
                    <code>
                        p
                        selects &lt;p>
                    </code>
                </pre>
                </td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>ID selector</td>
                <td>
                  The element on the page with the specified ID. On a given HTML
                  page, each id value should be unique.
                </td>

                <td>
                  <pre>
                    <code>
                        #my-id
                        selects &lt;p id="my-id"> or
                        &lt;a id="my-id">
                    </code>
                  </pre>
                </td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Class selector</td>
                <td>
                  The element(s) on the page with the specified class. Multiple
                  instances of the same class can appear on a page.
                </td>
                <td>

                    </pre>
                </td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Attribute selector</td>
                <td>
                  The element(s) on the page with the specified attribute.
                </td>

                <td>
                  The specified element(s), but only when in the specified
                  state. (For example, when a cursor hovers over a link.)
                </td>
                <td>
                  <pre>

                            a:hover
                            selects &lt;a>, but only when the
                            mouse pointer is hovering over the link.
                        </code>

<!-- User Story #1: I can see a main element with a corresponding id="main-doc", which contains the page's main content (technical documentation). -->

<!-- User Story #2: Within the #main-doc element, I can see several section elements, each with a class of main-section. There should be a minimum of 5. -->

<!-- User Story #3: The first element within each .main-section should be a header element which contains text that describes the topic of that section. -->

<!-- User Story #4: Each section element with the class of main-section should also have an id that corresponds with the text of each header contained within it. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The section that contains the header "JavaScript and Java" should have a corresponding id="JavaScript_and_Java"). -->

<!-- User Story #5: The .main-section elements should contain at least 10 p elements total (not each). -->

<!-- User Story #6: The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 code elements total (not each). -->

<!-- User Story #7: The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 li items total (not each). -->

<!-- User Story #8: I can see a nav element with a corresponding id="navbar". -->

<!-- User Story #9: The navbar element should contain one header element which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation. -->

<!-- User Story #10: Additionally, the navbar should contain link (a) elements with the class of nav-link. There should be one for every element with the class main-section. -->

<!-- User Story #11: The header element in the navbar must come before any link (a) elements in the navbar. -->

<!-- User Story #12: Each element with the class of nav-link should contain text that corresponds to the header text within each section (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text "Hello world"). -->

<!-- User Story #13: When I click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the main-doc element (e.g. If I click on a nav-link element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a section element that has that id and contains the corresponding header. -->

<!-- User Story #14: On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with id="navbar" should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user. -->

<!-- User Story #15: My Technical Documentation page should use at least one media query. -->
