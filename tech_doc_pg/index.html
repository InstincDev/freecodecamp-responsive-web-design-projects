        <p>
          Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup
          language either. CSS is a style sheet language. CSS is what you use to
          selectively style HTML elements. For example, this CSS selects
          paragraph text, setting the color to red:
        </p>
        <code>p { color: red; }</code>
        <p>
          Let's try it out! Using a text editor, paste the three lines of CSS
          (above) into a new file. Save the file as style.css in a directory
          named styles.
        </p>
        <p>
          To make the code work, we still need to apply this CSS (above) to your
          HTML document. Otherwise, the styling won't change the appearance of
          the HTML. (If you haven't been following our project, pause here to
          read Dealing with files and
          <li></li>
          HTML basics.)
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Open your index.html file. Paste the following line in the head
            (between the
            <head>
              and
            </head>
            tags):
            <code>&lt;link href="styles/style.css" rel="stylesheet"></code>
          </li>
          <li>
            Save index.html and load it in your browser. You should see
            something like this:
            <img
              src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics/website-screenshot-styled.png"
              alt="A mozilla logo and some paragraphs. The paragraph text has been styled red by out css."
            />
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          If your paragraph text is red, congratulations! Your CSS is working.
        </p>
        <h3>Anatomy of a CSS ruleset</h3>
        <p>
          Let's dissect the CSS code for red paragraph text to understand how it
          works :
        </p>
        <img
          src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics/css-declaration-small.png"
          alt="close up image of the css code used to change paragragh element text red"
        />
        <p>
          The whole structure is called a ruleset. (The term ruleset is often
          referred to as just rule.) Note the names of the individual parts:
        </p>

        <h4>Selector</h4>
        <p>
          This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It defines
          the element(s) to be styled (in this example, &lt;p> elements). To
          style a different element, change the selector.
        </p>

        <h4>Declaration</h4>
        <p>
          This is a single rule like color: red;. It specifies which of the
          element's properties you want to style.
        </p>

        <h4>Properties</h4>
        <p>
          These are ways in which you can style an HTML element. (In this
          example, color is a property of the &lt;p>elements.) In CSS, you
          choose which properties you want to affect in the rule.
        </p>

        <h4>Property value</h4>
        <p>
          To the right of the property—after the colon—there is the property
          value. This chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given
          property. (For example, there are many color values in addition to
          red.)
        </p>

        <p>Note the other important parts of the syntax:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Apart from the selector, each ruleset must be wrapped in curly
            braces. ({})
          </li>
          <li>
            Within each declaration, you must use a colon (:) to separate the
            property from its value or values.
          </li>
          <li>
            Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon (;) to separate each
            declaration from the next one.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          To modify multiple property values in one ruleset, write them
          separated by semicolons, like this:
        </p>
        <code>p { color: red; width: 500px; border: 1px solid black; }</code>
        <h3>Selecting multiple elements</h3>
        <p>
          You can also select multiple elements and apply a single ruleset to
          all of them. Separate multiple selectors by commas. For example:
        </p>
        <code>p, li, h1 { color: red; }</code>
        <h3>Different types of selectors</h3>
        <p>
          There are many different types of selectors. The examples above use
          element selectors, which select all elements of a given type. But we
          can make more specific selections as well. Here are some of the more
          common types of selectors:
        </p>
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <td>Selector name</td>
              <td>What does it select</td>
              <td>Example</td>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>
                Element selector (sometimes called a tag or type selector)
              </td>
              <td>All HTML elements of the specified type.</td>
              <td>p selects &lt;p></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>ID selector</td>
              <td>
                The element on the page with the specified ID. On a given HTML
                page, each id value should be unique.
              </td>
              <td>#my-id selects &lt;p id="my-id"> or &lt;a id="my-id"></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Class selector</td>
              <td>
                The element(s) on the page with the specified class. Multiple
                instances of the same class can appear on a page.
              </td>
              <td>
                .my-class selects &lt;p class="my-class"> and &lt;a
                class="my-class">
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Attribute selector</td>
              <td>The element(s) on the page with the specified attribute.</td>
              <td>
                img[src] selects &lt;img src="myimage.png"> but not &lt;img>
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Pseudo-class selector</td>
              <td>
                The specified element(s), but only when in the specified state.
                (For example, when a cursor hovers over a link.)
              </td>
              <td>
                a:hover selects &lt;a>, but only when the mouse pointer is
                hovering over the link.
              </td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

<!-- User Story #1: I can see a main element with a corresponding id="main-doc", which contains the page's main content (technical documentation). -->

<!-- User Story #2: Within the #main-doc element, I can see several section elements, each with a class of main-section. There should be a minimum of 5. -->

<!-- User Story #3: The first element within each .main-section should be a header element which contains text that describes the topic of that section. -->

<!-- User Story #4: Each section element with the class of main-section should also have an id that corresponds with the text of each header contained within it. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The section that contains the header "JavaScript and Java" should have a corresponding id="JavaScript_and_Java"). -->

<!-- User Story #5: The .main-section elements should contain at least 10 p elements total (not each). -->

<!-- User Story #6: The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 code elements total (not each). -->

<!-- User Story #7: The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 li items total (not each). -->

<!-- User Story #8: I can see a nav element with a corresponding id="navbar". -->

<!-- User Story #9: The navbar element should contain one header element which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation. -->

<!-- User Story #10: Additionally, the navbar should contain link (a) elements with the class of nav-link. There should be one for every element with the class main-section. -->

<!-- User Story #11: The header element in the navbar must come before any link (a) elements in the navbar. -->

<!-- User Story #12: Each element with the class of nav-link should contain text that corresponds to the header text within each section (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text "Hello world"). -->

<!-- User Story #13: When I click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the main-doc element (e.g. If I click on a nav-link element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a section element that has that id and contains the corresponding header. -->

<!-- User Story #14: On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with id="navbar" should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user. -->

<!-- User Story #15: My Technical Documentation page should use at least one media query. -->
